## Commits

- Use conventional commits with scopes for title.
- In the body, include the motivation, summary of changes, and anything else of
  note.
- At bottom: "Co-authored with <Assistant> (<model>, reasoning <level>)"
- If and only if YOU are the Codex tool, use the top-level `model` and
  `model_reasoning_effort` values from `~/.codex/config.toml` for `<model>` and
  `<level>` when present (not relevant for Antigravity or other non-Codex
  assistants).
- If the exact assistant name, model and reasoning level are unknown and cannot
  be inferred, ask the user before committing and then reuse that answer for the
  rest of the session.
